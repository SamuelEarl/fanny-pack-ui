# Get Started

# Install
These instructions will show you how to install Fanny Pack and configure it to use a customized theme that matches your app.


## Step 1: Install Fanny Pack UI
```
npm install @fanny-pack-ui/svelte-kit
```

_**NOTE:** This will also install the `@iconify/svelte` package. So you can use Iconify icons throughout your SvelteKit app. See [Iconify for Svelte](https://docs.iconify.design/icon-components/svelte/) for more details._

<br>

## Step 2: Configure the theme for your app
The CSS theme that you create on the [Customize Theme](/customize-theme) page uses native CSS variables. These variables allow a lot of flexibility in how you can enable the CSS theme for your components, but this is my preferred way:

1. Create a `/src/assets/` folder in your SvelteKit project.
2. Open your `node_modules/@fanny-pack-ui/svelte-kit/` directory and copy the `styles/` directory into your `/src/assets/` directory. The following is an explanation of the files that are inside the `styles/` directory. You can modify the `theme.css` and `base.css` files to update your theme:
    1. `preflight.css` : This contains TailwindCSS's [Preflight](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/preflight) code with a few minor modifications. (You can read the comments at the top of the `preflight.css` file for details of the modifications.) Since Preflight is built on top of [modern-normalize](https://github.com/sindresorhus/modern-normalize), this file is used instead of a normalize CSS file.
    2. `theme.css` : This file contains the CSS variables that make up your theme. Follow the instructions in this file to create your theme. You will update the color palette and any other variable values that you feel are necessary.
    3. `utility-classes.css` and the `utility-classes` folder : The `utility-classes.css` file imports the utility classes that are used throughout the components and that can be used in your app. Feel free to add more utility classes as needed, but don't change the existing class names otherwise you will break styles in the components. The utility classes are organized in the `utility-classes` folder.
    4. `base.css` : This file contains default styles for HTML elements. The `preflight.css` file clears many of the default styles for HTML elements, so you need to define default styles for your HTML elements in this file. Feel free to change any or all of the base styles in this file.
    5. `media-queries.css` : This file contains the media queries that are used in the components and that can be used throughout your app.
3. Create a `fonts.css` file inside of your `/src/assets/styles` directory. This file will hold all of your font definitions.
4. Create a `main.css` file inside of your `/src/assets/styles` directory and add the following imports:

```css
@import "preflight.css";
@import "fonts.css";
@import "theme.css";
@import "utility-classes.css";
@import "base.css";
```

_**NOTE:** CSS styles that are declared later will override styles that are declared earlier, so the order of these imports matters._

Import the `/src/assets/styles/main.css` file into the `<script>` tag of the `/src/routes/+layout.svelte` file, like this:

```html
<script>
  import "/src/assets/styles/main.css";
</script>
```

<br>

## Step 3: Update your linting and formatting configs (optional)

This is only my personal preference. You do what works for you.

I am not a big fan of either Prettier or ESLint for formatting. (Maybe I am missing something that would make me really love one of those options.) Prettier has limited customizable options (e.g. no `brace-style` option&mdash;what?!&mdash;and other default formatting that I don't love but am unable to change) and ESLint doesn't format things very well (e.g. the `brace-style` option left `else` and `catch` blocks improperly indented. Ugh! 

The best option (for me at least) might be to create a lint script that uses ESLint to give me warnings about poorly formatted code and then I will just manually fix those issues myself (instead of using the `--fix` flag to auto format my code). 

This is how I do that: 

(1) Add custom linting rules inside the `rules` block in your `.eslintrc.cjs`, like this:

```js
module.exports = {
  root: true,
  parser: "@typescript-eslint/parser",
  extends: ["eslint:recommended", "plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended", "prettier"],
  plugins: ["svelte3", "@typescript-eslint"],
  ignorePatterns: ["*.cjs"],
  overrides: [{ files: ["*.svelte"], processor: "svelte3/svelte3" }],
  settings: {
    "svelte3/typescript": () => require("typescript"),
  },
  parserOptions: {
    sourceType: "module",
    ecmaVersion: 2020,
  },
  env: {
    browser: true,
    es2017: true,
    node: true,
    },
  rules: {
    "quotes": ["error", "double"], // This is the default, but making it explicit.
    "comma-dangle": ["warn", "always-multiline"],
    "semi": ["error", "always"], // This is the default, but making it explicit.
    "no-extra-semi": "error",
    "brace-style": ["error", "stroustrup"],
  },
};
```

_See ESLint's [Rules Reference](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/rules/) for more details._

(2) Create a `lint` script that will check the files in your SvelteKit app, like this:

```
"scripts": {
	...
	"lint": "eslint '**/*.svelte' '**/*.js' '**/*.ts'",
},
```

(3) Now you can run `npm run lint` to check your SvelteKit files for poorly formatted code.

---

You _can_ use ESLint to automatically reformat your code with the `--fix` flag, but ESLint's formatting might not work the way you hope. However, I recommend that you test ESLint's formatting on a single file to see if you like it before running ESLint's formatter on all of your files. You can test out a single Svelte file by running `npx eslint src/routes/path/to/file/+page.svelte --fix` from the command line in your project's root directory.

If you like ESLint's automatic formatting, then you could create a script for it that would look like this: 

```
"scripts": {
	...
	"format_with_eslint": "eslint '**/*.svelte' '**/*.js' '**/*.ts' --fix",
},
```

---

If I were to use Prettier, these are some of my personal preferences for formatting rules:

* Double quotes for strings (because many other statically typed languages use double quotes for strings)
* Trailing commas
* Statements are terminated with semicolons

You can see the available options for Prettier [here](https://prettier.io/docs/en/options.html).

In my `.prettierrc` file, I would delete the current formatting options and paste the following formatting options in their place:

```json
{
	"useTabs": true,
	"singleQuote": false,
	"trailingComma": "es5",
	"printWidth": 100,
	"semi": true,
	"plugins": ["prettier-plugin-svelte"],
	"pluginSearchDirs": ["."],
	"overrides": [{ "files": "*.svelte", "options": { "parser": "svelte" } }]
}
```

Then, if I kept the default `lint` and `format` scripts in my `package.json`, I could run `npm run lint` to see which files need style formatting and `npm run format` to format those files with Prettier.

<br>

## Step 4: Configure Media Queries

1. Install `svelte-preprocess` and `@csstools/postcss-global-data` as `devDependencies` :<br>`npm install --save-dev svelte-preprocess @csstools/postcss-global-data`
2. Open your `svelte.config.js` file and change the code to match this:

```js
import adapter from "@sveltejs/adapter-auto";
import { vitePreprocess } from "@sveltejs/kit/vite";
import sveltePreprocess from "svelte-preprocess";
import postcssGlobalData from "@csstools/postcss-global-data";

/** @type {import("@sveltejs/kit").Config} */
const config = {
  preprocess: [
    vitePreprocess(),
    sveltePreprocess({
      postcss: {
        plugins: [
          postcssGlobalData({
            files: [
              "src/assets/styles/media-queries.css",
            ],
          }),
        ],
      },
    }),
  ],
  
  kit: {
    adapter: adapter(),
  },
};

export default config;
```

<br>

Now you can use media queries like this throughout your app:

```css
@media (--xs-up) {
  .selector {
    padding: 15px;
  }
}

@media (--m-up) {
  .selector {
    padding: 20px;
  }
}

@media (--xl-min) and (--xl-max) {
  .selector {
    padding: 25px;
  }
}
```

_**NOTES:**_

* _It is recommended to leave the `@custom-media` variable definitions as they are defined in your `media-queries.css` file. However, if you really need to change any of the `@custom-media` queries, then make sure that you only change the pixel values. If you change any of the variable names or the `min-width` or `max-width` properties, then the component styles could break._
* _For more details about `@custom-media` rules see [PostCSS Custom Media](https://github.com/csstools/postcss-plugins/tree/main/plugins/postcss-custom-media)._
* _This link provides an example of how to configure the `svelte-preprocess` config: https://github.com/zamkevich/Svelte-preprocess-config/blob/master/README.md._

<br>

## Step 5: Configure Native CSS Nesting Rules (Optional)

You can use [native CSS nesting](https://kilianvalkhof.com/2021/css-html/css-nesting-specificity-and-you/) by adding the `postcssPresetEnv()` config in your `svelte.config.js` file.

1. Install `postcss-preset-env` as a `devDependencies` package :<br>`npm install --save-dev postcss-preset-env`
2. Update your `svelte.config.js` file to match this:

```js
import adapter from "@sveltejs/adapter-auto";
import { vitePreprocess } from "@sveltejs/kit/vite";
import sveltePreprocess from "svelte-preprocess";
import postcssGlobalData from "@csstools/postcss-global-data";
import postcssPresetEnv from "postcss-preset-env";

/** @type {import("@sveltejs/kit").Config} */
const config = {
  preprocess: [
    vitePreprocess(),
    sveltePreprocess({
      postcss: {
        plugins: [
          postcssGlobalData({
            files: [
              "src/assets/styles/media-queries.css",
            ],
          }),
          postcssPresetEnv({
            stage: 0,
            features: {
              "nesting-rules": true,
            },
            browsers: "last 2 versions",
          }),
        ],
      },
    }),
  ],
  
  kit: {
    adapter: adapter(),
  },
};

export default config;
```

_**NOTES:**_

* _Configure nesting rules through the `postcss-preset-env` plugin: [PostCSS Preset Env](https://github.com/csstools/postcss-plugins/tree/main/plugin-packs/postcss-preset-env)_
* _If you are using VS Code and would like to configure it to provide syntax highlighting for native CSS nesting rules, then in VS Code disable "Svelte plugin CSS diagnostics" and install the "PostCSS Language Support" extension. This will prevent false error highlighting. See [PostCSS Syntax Highlighting with Svelte in VS Code](https://www.ryanfiller.com/blog/tips/svelte-postcss-syntax-highlighting)_

<h2 id="install-fonts">Step 6: Install &amp; Configure Fonts</h2>

No fonts are included in your theme files. However, the components in this library will inherit the fonts that you define for your app. Here is an easy way to install fonts in your app:

1. Go to [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) and search for the fonts you want to use.
2. When you select a font there is a button in the top-right of the screen that says "Download family". Click that button.
3. Create a `/src/assets/fonts/` folder in your SvelteKit project. For each font, create a folder inside of the `/src/assets/fonts/` directory and name each folder after the name of the font. For example, the `Helvetica Neue` font would have a folder named `helvetica-neue`.
4. Unzip/extract the font folders that you downloaded from Google Fonts. When you open the unzipped font folders you should see either a bunch of files with `.ttf` file extensions or a `static` folder. _(You might see some files that have `VariableFont` as part of their name. Those fonts should have a `README` file that might explain more about how the `VariableFonts` can be used. I usually use the static versions because they are better supported right now.)_
5. For each font, copy all the static font files (they might be directly inside the font folder that you extracted or in the `static` folder) and paste them into their respective font folder that you created inside `/src/assets/fonts/`.
6. Open your `/src/assets/styles/fonts.css` file and create an `@font-face` style rule for each of your fonts. For example, this is how a `@font-face` rule might look for the `Helvetica Neue Bold` font ([read about `@font-face` rules on MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@font-face)):

```css
@font-face {
  font-family: "Helvetica Neue";
  src: local("Helvetica Neue Bold"), local("HelveticaNeue-Bold"),
    url("../fonts/helvetica-neue/HelveticaNeue-Bold.ttf") format("truetype");
  font-weight: bold;
  font-style: normal;
}
```

_**NOTE:** This article explains how to [use multiple font styles and weights the right way](https://www.hacksoft.io/blog/using-multiple-font-files-the-right-way)._


7. In your `theme.css` file, find the `Font Families` variables under the `TYPOGRAPHY` section:

```css
/* TYPOGRAPHY */
:root {
  /* Font Families */
  --sans-serif: Montserrat, "sans-serif";
  --serif: "Bitstream Charter", "serif";
  --cursive: Audiowide, cursive;
  --monospace: "Source Code Pro", "monospace";

  ...
```

There are a few font family variables already defined. You can change the values to match your fonts and even add other font family variables. Note that the font names that are used in the font family variables are taken from the `font-family` properties in your `/src/assets/styles/fonts.css` file.

In your `/src/assets/styles/base.css` file, find all the `font-family` rules and update them to match your font family variables. Feel free to add more `font-family` rules to other elements as needed.

<br>

<h2 id="configure-default-component-styles">Step 7: Configure Default Component Styles</h2>

Toward the bottom of your `theme.css` file are some default styles for various components. Feel free to change those default styles however you would like.

Note that many of the Fanny Pack components have props that are not CSS styles, which makes it a bit more difficult to configure default settings in a global file like the `theme.css` file. The `btnIconDisabled` prop in `<Button>` components is one example. If you want to use global settings and simply reference those in your components, then you could do something like this:

1. Create a `/src/fp.configs.js` file (or name it whatever you want).
2. Create an object inside that file that will contain default settings for your components.
3. Reference those values in your components.

That might look something like this:

```js
// /src/fp.configs.js

export const defaults = {
  btnIconDisabled: "bi:gear-wide-connected",
  ...
};
```

```js
// /src/routes/+page.svelte

import { defaults } from "/src/fp.configs.js";

<Button btnIconDisabled={defaults.btnIconDisabled}>
  My Button Text
</Button>
```

You could also copy and paste any Fanny Pack components from the GitHub repo into your own local `components` directory, set the default props that you want to use, and just import your local UI components into your pages.

<br>

## Step 8: Add your favicon to your app

If you have an SVG image of your favicon, then that might be the best image format to use.

1. Go to [Favicon Generator](https://realfavicongenerator.net/), click the button that says "Select your Favicon image", and follow the instructions.
2. When you get to the last section titled "Favicon Generator Options," make sure that the option for "I will place favicon files (favicon.ico, apple-touch-icon.png, etc.) at the root of my web site. Recommended." is selected and click the "Generate your Favicons and HTML code".
3. After downloading your favicon pack, unzip/extract the icons directly into your `/static/` folder. 
4. Open your `/src/app.html` file and replace the `<link rel="icon" href="%sveltekit.assets%/favicon.png" />` tag with the `<link>` and `<meta>` tags from Favicon Generator.
5. Prefix all of the icon references with `%sveltekit.assets%`. Your `app.html` file should look similar to this:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <meta name="description" content="Description goes here..." />
    
    <link rel="apple-touch-icon" sizes="180x180" href="%sveltekit.assets%/apple-touch-icon.png">
    <link rel="icon" type="image/png" sizes="32x32" href="%sveltekit.assets%/favicon-32x32.png">
    <link rel="icon" type="image/png" sizes="16x16" href="%sveltekit.assets%/favicon-16x16.png">
    <link rel="manifest" href="%sveltekit.assets%/site.webmanifest">
    <link rel="mask-icon" href="%sveltekit.assets%/safari-pinned-tab.svg" color="#5bbad5">
    <meta name="msapplication-TileColor" content="#ffffff">
    <meta name="theme-color" content="#ffffff">
    
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" />
    %sveltekit.head%
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="svelte">%sveltekit.body%</div>
  </body>
</html>
```

<br>

## Conclusion
Your theme should now be enabled when you start your app. You can use the CSS variables from your `theme.css` file and the utility classes throughout your app. When you use the components with the theme that you created, you might decide to change some of your variable values. Feel free to change your CSS variable values following the instructions inside your `theme.css` file.

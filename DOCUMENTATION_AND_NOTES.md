# Fanny Pack UI - Components Built with and for SvelteKit
**NOTE: Webpack throws errors with import statements that use aliases like `$`. So I don't think I can use Storybook. Oh, well. I will just create my own interactive documentation using MDSVEX. Webpack is pretty slow and I don't love using apps like Storybook because of the limitations that you run into sometimes, so I prefer to create my own interactive documentation.**

# How to develop new components or edit existing components
1. I should create the component first inside the `/src/lib` directory (which is where a component library would need to be created).
2. Then test that component out on a page in the `/src/routes` directory to make sure that the component works properly in a regular SvelteKit app.
3. Write comprehensive tests for the component.
4. Then, for documentation purposes and to give other developers the ability to try out different variations of each component, I will create interactive documentation with controls (similar to what Storybook does) for each component in the `/src/routes` directory. These docs will be similar to the docs found in Carbon Components Svelte (https://carbon-components-svelte.onrender.com/) and maybe Semantic UI.


## Documentation Ideas and Organization
I am referencing https://carbon-components-svelte.onrender.com/ for ideas on how to create this documentation.

# How to add `postcss-preset-env` (for native CSS nesting) and `mdsvex` (for Markdown documentation)

* The `postcss-preset-env` config and notes are below.
* Use `svelte-add` to install `mdsvex`, which will configure everything for you: https://github.com/svelte-add/mdsvex. Then you can create `.svelte.md` files and start creating regular Svelte components with Markdown syntax sprinkled throughout. I like to use Markdown to document code blocks in between opening and closing triple backticks. 
    * NOTE: I think `mdsvex` conflicts with Storybook's MDX installation and throws silent errors, so if you want to install `mdsvex` alongside Storybook then you might run into problems. I would just use the default MDX installation.

```js
// svelte.config.js

import { mdsvex } from "mdsvex";
import mdsvexConfig from "./mdsvex.config.js";
import adapter from "@sveltejs/adapter-auto";
import preprocess from "svelte-preprocess";
import postcssPresetEnv from "postcss-preset-env";
// __dirname is not available in ES modules: https://nodejs.org/api/esm.html#esm_no_filename_or_dirname
// This issue has a fix: https://github.com/nodejs/help/issues/2907
import path from "path";
import { fileURLToPath } from "url";
const __filename = fileURLToPath(import.meta.url);
const __dirname = path.dirname(__filename);

/** @type {import("@sveltejs/kit").Config} */
const config = {
	extensions: [".svelte", ...mdsvexConfig.extensions],

	// Consult https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte-preprocess
	// for more information about preprocessors
	preprocess: [
		preprocess({
			postcss: {
				plugins: [
					// * How to configure the postcssPresetEnv plugin:
					// https://github.com/zamkevich/Svelte-preprocess-config/blob/master/README.md

					postcssPresetEnv({

							"nesting-rules": true
						},

					})
				]
			}
		}),
		mdsvex(mdsvexConfig)
	],

	kit: {
		adapter: adapter(),

		// hydrate the <div id="svelte"> element in src/app.html
		target: "#svelte",

		vite: () => ({
			// Aliases: https://dev.to/danawoodman/how-to-add-module-import-aliases-in-sveltekit-2ck
			resolve: {

					$: path.resolve(__dirname, "/src")
				}
			},

			server: {
				fs: {
					allow: ["package"]
				}
			}
		})
	}
};

export default config;

# How to update SveltKit to latest version

1. Search for "sveltekit changelog".
2. Find the latest version number.
3. Run `npm update @sveltejs/kit@<version#>`. For example: `npm update @sveltejs/kit@1.0.0-next.445`

# How to Create an NPX Tool

See these posts (there is good information in each one and they are short, so read them both):

## Deleting globally installed packages

You can check which npm packages are installed globally with `npm ls -g`. When you run that command it will show you where those packages are installed (e.g. `/home/<USER>/.volta/tools/image/node/16.17.0/lib`). To delete those globally installed packages I had to manually delete those in the file system because `npm uninstall -g <package-name>` threw errors and would not remove the packages. Hmmm.

## NPX Naming Conventions

You can let users invoke your command line application in two different ways:

1. Invoke it with the name of your package: `npx @fanny-pack-ui/svelte-kit`
2. Invoke it with a different name: `npx install-fpui-svelte-kit` (`create-react-app` is an example of this). In this case you need to set a different name for your command line application that will be used to invoke your command line application. This name can be different from the name of your package.

If you want to use the first pattern, then you need to set your `bin` field in your `package.json` file like this:

```
"bin": "bin/index.js",
```

If you want to use the second pattern, then you need to set your `bin` field like this:

```
"bin": {
  "install-fpui-svelte-kit": "bin/index.js"
},
```

Note that in this second version the package name that you use as the key in the `bin` field cannot contain symbols such as `@` or `/`. If you want to separate words, then you have to use dashes to separate them.
